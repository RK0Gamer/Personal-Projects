Project Summary 
For this project, we wanted to create a report on copper, gold, palladium, platinum and silver future data. Using python, we extracted the data from Yahoo Finance api and performed the necessary preprocessing. After processing the data, we used SQL to create and insert a table for each metal into SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) for storage purposes. This step was all done within python. Next we ran a query within SSMS to create a combined table containing every data from every precious metal. This table is then converted into csv to import into Tableau Public. Using Tableau Public we create a report showcasing montly transactions and trends in value percentage change.
