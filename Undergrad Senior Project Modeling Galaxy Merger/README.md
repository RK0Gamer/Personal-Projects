# Undergraduate Senior Project: Modeling Galaxy Merger

## Project Description
This is my academic research paper for my Astrophysics senior project. For this project I used a custom made program provided by my mentor to simulate colliding galaxies. The goal is to find a set of parameters that can recreate a galaxy merger similar to NGC 6240, a pair of galaxies in the process of being merged. The results of our simulation show a sufficiently large amount of dark matter is require to recreate NGC 6240.
